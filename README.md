This AI Lab has three IoT Devices, one autonomous vehicle, a "public radio", and a data mart.  It was designed to teach youth about robotics and artificial intelligence, but adults like it too.

AstroPiQuake is an environment sensor that can also detect earthquakes.  It is easy to build with snap together parts.
Try out the <a href="https://trinket.io/python/9c2e984979">AstroPiQuake emulator</a>.  Move the temperature slider to see Smiley's face change colors from cool blue to mellow yellow to red hot. Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AstroPiQuake">instructions</a> to build it

<h2><a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Enviro">Enviro</a></h2>
Enviro is an environment sensor that can also detect sky color to help forecast weather.  To build it, you must solder and snap together parts.  Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Enviro">instructions</a>

<h2><a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Air_MacClean">Air MacClean</a></h2>
Air MacClean is a CO2 and TVOC sensor.  To build it, you must solder and attach wires.  Follow these 
<a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Air_MacClean">instructions</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Bumblebee_AV">Bumblebee AV</a></h2>
Bumblebee AV is a simple autonomous vehicle.  There are many ways to build the vehicle.  These 
<a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Bumblebee_AV">instructions</a> recommend LegosTM and robot parts.  The motor controller must be soldered and wires, motors, and wheels must be attached.  I do not recommend using a three-wheel robot with a coaster wheel because it is difficult to control when turning left or right.  

<h2><a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AI_Lab/blob/master/PublicRadio.md">Public Radio</a></h2>
Public radio can run on an edge computing device such as a <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AI_Lab/blob/master/PublicRadio_RaspberryPi.md">Raspberry Pi 4</a>, a computer, or an <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AI_Lab/blob/master/PublicRadio.md">Oracle VirtualBox</a>.
