This STEM Lab was designed by a retired NASA software specialist to introduce students to data science.  Like  rovers on Mars, the Bumblebee rover uses sensors to explore its environment.  As the rover explores, it sends sensor readings to a public data cloud where it can be downloaded and used to conduct data science experiments.

AstroPiQuake is an environment sensor that can also detect earthquakes.  Try out the <a href="https://trinket.io/python/9c2e984979">AstroPiQuake emulator</a>.  Move the temperature slider to see Smiley's face change colors from cool blue to mellow yellow to red hot. Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AstroPiQuake">instructions</a> to build your own environment sensor with parts that snap together.

Enviro is an environment sensor that can also detect sky color to help forecast weather.  To build it, you must be able to solder wires to circuit boards.  Follow these <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Enviro">instructions</a>

Air MacClean is a CO2 and TVOC sensor.  To build it, you must solder and attach wires.  Follow these 
<a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Air_MacClean">instructions</a>.

<h2><a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Bumblebee_AV">Bumblebee AV</a></h2>
Bumblebee is a rover that can understand a simple goal and generate a plan for driving along a path.  There are many ways to build the vehicle.  These 
<a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/Bumblebee_AV">instructions</a> recommend LegosTM and robot parts.  The motor controller must be soldered and wires, motors, and wheels must be attached.  I do not recommend using a three-wheel robot with a coaster wheel because it is difficult to control when turning left or right.  

<h2>Public Data Cloud</a></h2>
The public data cloud can run on an edge computing device such as a <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AI_Lab/blob/master/PublicDataCloud_Raspbian.md">Raspberry Pi 4</a>, a computer, or an <a href="https://github.com/NelsonPython/AI_Lab/blob/master/PublicDataCloud_VirtualBox.md">Oracle VirtualBox</a>.
